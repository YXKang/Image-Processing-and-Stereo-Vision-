# Image-Processing-and-Stereo-Vision-
Programmed in python an image processing algorithms in order to preform 1-Dimension, 2- Dimension and Histogram analysis on an image. Also designed and programmed a stereo vision algorithm to find the disparity map estimation between 2 rectified images of the same object using basic block matching and dynamic programming in order to perform View Interpolation.
